# Watchers
A 2D platformer game with handdrawn sprites and an art & combat style that's heavily inspired by Hollow Knight and other metroidvanias.
# About This Project
This project is considered to be a solo, learning project to improve at C# and Unity. It's aimed to use the Universal Render Pipeline later for better 2D lights and will contain an inventory and basic skill system.
